# urlshortner

It would be a url shortnet like tiny url.

# cases/deatures I am going to handle : 
 - [ ]  accept a URL as an argument over a REST API and return a shortened URL as a result.
 - [ ] The URL and shortened URL should be stored in memory by application.
 - [ ] [BONUS] Instead of in memory, store these things in a text file.
 - [ ] If I again ask for the same URL, it should give me the same URL as it gave before instead of generang a new one.
 - [ ] [BONUS] Put this applicaon in a Docker image by wring a Dockerfile and provide the docker image link along with the source code link.
